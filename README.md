# Deafsy
Listens constantly for microphone input while sending all to google cloud speech to text. The parsed text is sent to a discord chanenl via webhook.  

The intention is to help include deaf players in spoken conversation.  When playing games with a deaf player, a hearing capable player must either type ingame or in discord chat to communicate.  If there is any spoken conversation between hearing capable players, the deaf player is not included.  

### Problems
Google sppech to text works wonderfully if you are aware of the recording and carefully speak.  However, there are difficulties translating mumbled speech or if you forget that you are recording voice.

### To Do
Finish option to only record when a button is pressed instead of always on.
